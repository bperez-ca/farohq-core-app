# FARO Agency Pricing & Features Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the pricing tiers and features available to marketing agencies using FARO's white-label Local Visibility platform. FARO enables agencies to offer enterprise-grade local marketing software under their own brand.

---

## Pricing Model: Three Revenue Layers

FARO uses a **License + Wallet Model** that separates fixed costs from variable usage:

1. **Agency Platform License** – What you pay for access to FARO (monthly flat fee)
2. **Location Wholesale Pricing** – What you pay per SMB location managed (per location/month)
3. **Usage Wallet** – Variable costs (WhatsApp, SMS, AI) billed as used, with agency markup

---

## Layer 3: Usage Wallet (Variable Costs)

**What this covers:** Pay-as-you-go consumption (WhatsApp conversations, SMS, AI credits, reports)

### How the Wallet Works

1. **Pre-load credit** (like AWS or Stripe) – e.g., $50
2. **Usage deducts automatically** – WhatsApp conversations, AI generation, SMS segments
3. **Set your own markup** – Charge clients 1.5x-3x what FARO charges you
4. **Auto-reload** – Configure threshold (e.g., reload $50 when balance hits $20)

---

### Wallet Pricing by Region

| Usage Type | FARO Cost (Pass-Through) | Suggested Agency Markup | Your Profit |
|------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **LATAM** | | | |
| WhatsApp conversation (overage) | $0.0085 (Meta rate) | $0.015-$0.02 | 76-135% |
| AI credits (1,000 tokens) | $0.015 (GPT-3.5) | $0.03-$0.05 | 100-233% |
| Impact Report | $1.00-$4.00 (APIs + compute) | $8-$99 | 200-2,375% |
| **North America** | | | |
| SMS message (overage) | $0.015 (Twilio) | $0.03-$0.05 | 100-233% |
| AI credits (1,000 tokens) | $0.015 | $0.03-$0.05 | 100-233% |
| Impact Report | $1.00-$4.00 | $8-$99 | 200-2,375% |

**Platform Fee:** FARO keeps 5-10% on usage pass-through. You keep the rest.

---

### Included Usage by Location Tier

| Tier | WhatsApp Convos (LATAM) | SMS Messages (NA) | Overage Rate |
|------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Basic | 500/month | 500/month | Wallet rate + markup |
| Plus | 2,000/month | 2,000/month | Wallet rate + markup |
| Pro | 5,000/month | 5,000/month | Wallet rate + markup |
| Elite | 15,000/month | 15,000/month | Wallet rate + markup |

**Example:** If a Pro-tier client exceeds 5,000 WhatsApp conversations in LATAM:
- Conversation #5,001+: FARO charges you $0.0085/convo
- You charge your client $0.015-$0.02/convo
- You keep $0.0065-$0.0115 per conversation (76-135% margin)

## Agency Profit Calculator: Real Examples

### Example 1: LATAM Agency – Restaurant Chain (3 Locations)

| Item | You Pay FARO | You Charge Client | Your Margin |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Platform License** | Growth: $249/month | (Hidden in retainer) | — |
| **3 Locations** | 3 × $45 = $135/month | 3 × $150 = $450/month | $315/month |
| **WhatsApp Usage** | 1,500 convos × $0.0085 = $12.75 | Billed as "Messaging Package" $30 | $17.25 |
| **AI Credits** | Included up to limit | Value-add | — |
| **TOTAL** | $396.75/month | $480/month | **$83.25/month (21% margin)** |

*Note: This example shows modest margin. Most agencies charge $450-750/retainer for 3 locations, increasing total margin to 40-60%.*

---

### Example 2: North America Agency – HVAC Company (1 Location)

| Item | You Pay FARO | You Charge Client | Your Margin |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Platform License** | Starter: $79/month | (Hidden in retainer) | — |
| **1 Location** | 1 × $78 = $78/month | $199/month | $121/month |
| **SMS Usage** | 1,000 msgs × $0.015 = $15 | Billed as "Text Package" $50 | $35 |
| **TOTAL** | $172/month | $249/month | **$77/month (45% margin)** |

---

### Example 3: LATAM Agency – Scale Tier with 30 Locations

| Item | You Pay FARO | You Charge Client | Your Margin |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Platform License** | Growth: $249/month | (Amortized across clients) | — |
| **30 Locations** | 30 × $45 = $1,350/month | 30 × $80 = $2,400/month | $1,050/month |
| **WhatsApp Usage** | ~$40/month (moderate) | Billed as "Comms Package" $75 | $35 |
| **TOTAL** | $1,639/month | $2,475/month | **$836/month (51% margin)** |

**Key Insight:** Most agencies recover their FARO cost with just 1-2 active clients. Everything after that is profit.

---

## Agency Resale Pricing: What to Charge SMBs

### Typical SMB Pricing by Region

| Region | Single Location SMB | Multi-Location Chain (per location) |
|--------|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| **LATAM** | $80-$150/month | $60-$90/month |
| **North America** | $149-$299/month | $99-$199/month |

**Why the range?**
- Lower end: Competitive markets, price-sensitive SMBs
- Higher end: Premium positioning, high-touch service, enterprise clients
- Volume discount: Multi-location clients expect lower per-location pricing

---

## Impact Reports: Your Secret Weapon

### What Makes Impact Reports Different?

**Vendasta's $3 snapshot:**  
✗ "Your GBP needs 7 photos"  
✗ SMB reaction: "So what? When does my phone ring?"

**FARO's Monthly Revenue Impact Report:**  
✓ "You generated $3,600 revenue this month"  
✓ "47 new leads: 12 hot, 19 warm, 16 cold"  
✓ "WhatsApp drove $1,200 (4 bookings), GBP drove $2,100 (7 bookings)"  
✓ SMB reaction: "Show my accountant! This proves you're worth it."

---

### Report Tiers & Agency Margins

| Report Type | Included In | Your Cost | You Charge SMB | Margin |
|------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Visibility Check** | Basic: 1/month | $1.00 | $8-12/report | 700-1,100% |
| **Monthly Revenue Impact** | Plus: 4/month<br>Pro: 12/month | $2.50 | $19-29/month | 660-1,060% |
| **Competitive Intelligence** | Elite: 30/month | $4.50 | $49-99/month | 989-2,100% |
| **Weekly Snapshot** | Add-on | $3.50/report | $15/week | 329% |

**Key Positioning:** Impact Reports justify your retainer. SMBs see exactly how much money your services generate, reducing churn by 30-50%.

## Competitive Comparison

### FARO vs. Vendasta vs. Birdeye

| Platform | Agency Base Cost | Per-Location Cost | Total Per SMB | Typical Agency Margin |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Vendasta** | $99 (Essentials) | $20 (Listings) + $30 (Reviews) + $15 (Inbox) = $65 | **$164/SMB** | 40-50% |
| **Birdeye** | $0 (direct to SMB) | $299/location (all-in) | **$299/SMB** | 20-30% (resale) |
| **FARO** | $79 (÷20 clients = $4/client) | $45 (Plus location) + $10 (usage) | **$59/SMB** | **50-70%** |

**Your Advantage:**
- **70% cheaper than Birdeye** – Agencies can undercut competitors and still make 50% margins
- **70% cheaper than Vendasta** – No nickel-and-diming on per-product activations

## Operational Costs & Unit Economics

### What You Need to Know

**FARO's COGS per SMB (LATAM):**
- Platform overhead (infra, DB, storage): $3-8/location
- WhatsApp (variable): $5-100/location depending on volume
- **Total:** $8-108/location

**FARO's COGS per SMB (North America):**
- Platform overhead: $5-20/location (higher due to listings APIs)

## How Agencies Make Money with FARO

### 1. Pay FARO Wholesale Prices
- Agency platform license: $79-$499/month
- Per-location wholesale: $32-$148/location (region & tier dependent)
- Usage wallet: Pay only for what your clients use (WhatsApp, SMS, AI)

### 2. Package into Your Retainer
- Bundle local visibility (listings, reviews, inbox) into your monthly retainer
- Position as "Local Marketing HQ" or "Visibility & Reputation Package"
- Clients see value (reviews + leads + ROI reports), not cost

### 3. Charge a Platform Fee
- Most agencies add $50-150/location/month above FARO wholesale
- OR embed cost into $500-$2,000/month full-service retainer
- Use Impact Reports to justify your pricing

### 4. Use Dashboards to Retain Clients
- Send monthly Impact Reports showing revenue generated
- Quarterly business reviews using FARO's multi-location dashboards
- Upsell additional locations as clients grow

**Key Insight:** Most agencies recover their FARO cost with just 2-3 clients. Every additional location adds near-pure margin because delivery is standardized inside FARO HQ.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Billing & Pricing

**Q: Can I change tiers when my client grows?**  
A: Yes. Upgrade your client's location tier anytime, billed pro-rata. Example: Move a client from Plus ($45) to Pro ($62) mid-month, and pay the difference for the remaining days.

**Q: What's the minimum contract?**  
A: Month-to-month. No minimums. Cancel anytime.

**Q: How does WhatsApp/SMS overage work?**  
A: If your client exceeds their included quota (e.g., 2,000 WhatsApp convos on Plus), overage is billed to your usage wallet automatically. You'll get a notification at 80% usage. You can pass this cost to your client or absorb it.

**Q: How do I know my profit per client?**  
A: Your FARO dashboard shows:
- Total cost to FARO (platform + locations + usage)
- Recommended retail price (based on market data)
- Your profit per client per month

**Q: Do I pay for the WhatsApp Business API separately?**  
A: No. WhatsApp Meta conversation costs are included in overage fees. No hidden BSP (Business Solution Provider) costs.

---

### White-Label & Branding

**Q: Can I sell FARO under my own brand?**  
A: 100%. Starting at Growth tier, your clients see only your branding—no FARO logo. At Scale tier, you get a custom domain (e.g., portal.youragency.com).

**Q: Can I set my own markup on usage costs (WhatsApp, SMS, AI)?**  
A: Yes. Your FARO dashboard lets you set markup percentages (e.g., charge clients 1.5x what FARO charges you). We handle billing and show you the profit.

**Q: Do my clients know they're using FARO?**  
A: Only if you're on the Starter tier (which shows "Powered by FARO"). Growth and above are 100% white-label—clients think it's your proprietary software.

---

### Features & Limits

**Q: How many clients can I manage?**  
A: 
- Starter: 15 SMB clients, 30 locations
- Growth: 50 SMB clients, 150 locations
- Scale: 200 SMB clients, 600 locations
